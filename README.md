# TurtleSketch
Built by Katie Cunningham, in collaboration with Alex Goodwin (http://www.jagodwin.com/)
 
What if learners could create and interact with code in a more natural, more expressive way than typing--- 
through drawing and sketching?

TurtleSketch is a proposed programming environment that encourages small groups of students to work collaboratively at a 
large touchscreen in order to create complex turtle-based drawings through sketch-based creation and refactoring of code. 
Students start by sketching a pattern on the touchscreen, which is then translated into corresponding turtle code and shown 
alongside the students’ sketch. Students can then run the code to see the turtle’s drawing, or modify the code to add loops or 
additional code through sketched or typed modifications.

This is an initial prototype for TurtleSketch, built in Processing. To run it, simply install processing, as well as the 
ControlP5 and Tablet libraries, available in the Tools > Add Tool menu of the Processing IDE, and this Turtle library that 
you'll need to install by hand: https://github.com/leahbuechley/Turtle

I apologize for the hackiness and terrible OO Design of this. It will get better :)
